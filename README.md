## Run Instructions
1. Download/Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jdmar3-comp426/a99-new_team.git
```
2. Cd into the 'backend' and 'socket-chess' folders and run 'npm install' to make sure you have the dependencies dowloaded. 
```
cd a99-new_team/backend
npm install
cd ../socket-chess
npm install
```
3. Open two terminals. On one of them cd into the 'backend' folder and run 'npm start' to start the server.
```
cd ../backend
npm start
```
4. On the other cd into the 'socket-chess' folder and run 'npm start' to serve up the frontend.
```
cd a99-new_team/socket-chess
npm start
```
5. Open two incognito windows with the url for the frontend ('http://localhost:3000/'). This is important so you can simulate playing a game of chess between two users through the app. 
6. Now you can register 2 users, login and play chess!
