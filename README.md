## Run Instructions
1. Download/Clone repo
2. Cd into the 'backend' and 'socket-chess' folders and run 'npm install' to make sure you have the dependencies dowloaded. 
3. Open two terminals. On one of them cd into the 'backend' folder and run 'npm start' to start the server.
4. On the other cd into the 'socket-chess' folder and run 'npm start' to serve up the frontend.
5. Open two incognito windows with the url for the frontend ('http://localhost:3000/'). This is important so you can simulate playing a game of chess between two users through the app. 
6. Now you can register 2 users, login and play chess!
